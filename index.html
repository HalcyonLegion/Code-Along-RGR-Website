                We follow 3 core principles: Run, Gun and Rez. After countless hours on the 'field we found that this

            <br>
            <span class="mb-5">Sheriff Hooker was raised on the sleepy streets of Stratford, Texas where he saw every kind of crime imaginable,
                this small town boy moved to LA and quickly became a small town Sheriff and before he knew it he was fighting on the frontlines
                of Golmud, he doesn't know how he got there but all he knows is that he loves justice, and his trusty diving knife (despite living nowhere near the coast and never learning how to swim).
                He may have thought he knew what true crime was, that's until he joined the notorious RGR Squad. Sheriff Hooker now enforces RGR Law with extreme prejudice, as everybody knows
                under RGR justice every suspect is presumed guilty.</span>

            <br>
            <span class="mb-5">Detective Chief Inspector Dillinger was called to investigate reports of atrocities on the frontlines of the battlefield,
                he is a keen documenter and collects video evidence of everything he sees, and he has seen some stuff man. DCI Dillinger became
                involved with RGR early and has compiled several reports, unfortunately the majority of the footage depicts atrocities
                committed by the RGR squad themselves, so a lot of these reports are redacted. The impact the RGR Squad has had on the good DCI's sanity is made
                clear by his sadistic tendency of flying Manned Aerial Vehicles at terminal velocity into the heads of enemy infantry.</span>

            <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="Assets\fingers.png" alt="Captain John Fingers">
            <br>
            <span class="mb-5">John Fingers is an enigma, he carries the title Captain even though he was a Traffic Officer before war came calling.
                His dedication and commitment to road safety and traffic laws had gotten him into hot water with his former superiors,
                as the majority of the tickets he produced were against his own fellows on the force. In one sensational but unconfirmed case,
                John Fingers had to cut a date short to ticket a car parked illegally outside his own house, the car tragically belonged to his date who was
                absolutely not putting out that night. DCI Dillinger continues to investigate John's sordid and often uncomfortably erotic past.</span>

        <div class="col-md-6 mb-5 text-center">
            <h4 class="mb-3">Officer "BLUDSHOTE" Machete</h4>
            <img class="img-fluid mb-3" src="Assets\machete.png" alt="Officer Machete">
            <br>
            <span class="mb-5">Wildcard of the RGR Squad, he loves nothing more than delivering his trusty Machete into the heart of his enemies and to see them
                driven before him, he has also been known to scream "take it" and "right up cadbury alley". The throes of passion take
                Officer Machete to colorful places, nothing is known about his life before the battlefield. Some hypothesise that this life is all he
                has ever known, others believe he enlisted immediately and the initial psych assessment was cut short in more ways than one, by a certain blade.
                Legend has it that if you hear the Machete, you are already dead. His signature cry of "MACHETE KILLS AGAIN!" sends fear and horror into the hearts of his enemies.
                Due to recent allegations of battlefield brutality and war crimes against the RGR unit, Officer Machete has been doing some documentation of his own
                in the hopes of painting the squad in a kinder light. However, as John Fingers once famously said "there ain't enough water in the ocean to [REDACTED]".</span>

            <br>
            
            <span class="mb-5">Air Marshal Lovejoy may well be the only member of the RGR Squad with any formal military training at all.
                This is evidenced by his cool, calm and collected delivery of payload after payload of pure firey death-from-above punishment onto the enemy.
                Life in the cockpit can be lonely, and as a result the RGR squad have been issued several citations about the conditions in which these aerial vehicles are returned in,
                not for the reasons you'd expect. The "it's ectoplasm" excuse will only fly so far, if you forgive the pun. Whilst the case can be made that the use of aerial cluster munitions is
                indeed a war crime, that investigation would have to fall under the jurisdiction of the air force, and they are totally cool with it.</span>

            <br>
            <span class="mb-5">As elusive as the city of gold. Of all the RGR members you will not find one with such single-minded devotion to a weapon as our Chairman.
                This goes to the extent that any game which does not include the DAO Shotgun, he will not play.
                Dao (åˆ€ in Chinese) means Sword, this Shotgun is anything but this precise. The use of Shotguns on the battlefield is an absolute disgrace and you know that
                there will be collateral damage whenever the Chairman graces the 'field. He has been known to load this weapon with everything from standard buckshot,
                to flachette rounds and even frag rounds, the most heinous of munitions. Say what you want however, the man gets results. Even if they are left
                unrecognisable in a hail of indiscriminate rounds.</span>
